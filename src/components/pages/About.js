                <p>
                    I've always had a natural curiosity towards technology and so it was only a matter of time that
                    I would take up the chance to pursue a career in it. For me, coding gives me the ability to make
                    a real difference in the real world, provide value and solve problems that really matter. I want to keep
                    learning more about web development and new technologies to grow my skill set. I hope to meet and work with
                    like minded individuals. When I'm not coding, you can find me going on drives, reading, 
                    playing video games, rewatching my favourite shows and movies, etc.

                    I graduated from Humber college with a diploma in "Computer Programming". My graduation happened
                    during the pandemic and so pursuing further studies became difficult as most birdge programs were no longer supported.
                    I decided to take a free online certification in "Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures" to pass time and try to learn coding on my own.
                    I quickly realized how intimidating learning coding on your own can be and how real imposter syndrome is when looking for jobs.
                    After not finding much success - despite the many opportunities I was taking - I decided to return to my studies
                    at the University of Toronto, in their school of continuing studies. There, I received a certificate for successfully completing
                    their "Full-Stack Flex" Bootcamp. Here, I became a fully certified Full-Stack developer and even added many
                    different technologies and tools to my arsenal.
