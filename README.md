## Kush Patel's React Portfolio

## Usage
This React application is used to view my online portfolio! Users are brought to my home page by deafult and are
greeted by a welcome message and pictures of me. At the top, there is a navigation bar which will take users from
page to page. The about page has further information on me, the project page has my best projects on display and my contact page has a single form which allows users to get in touch with me via email. Instead of a footer, I'opted for to move the image icons to the top right in the navbar so that users do not have to scroll to find my social links and resume.
